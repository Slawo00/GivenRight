## Business Model Details

### Revenue Follows Trust
> "The better our decisions, the higher the trust, the stronger the monetization."

### Two Primary Revenue Streams:

#### 1. Affiliate Revenue (Transaction-Based)
**What it monetizes:**  
The action after a confident decision is made

**Characteristics:**
- Low friction
- Scales with usage
- No inventory risk
- Affiliate commissions from retailers

---

#### 2. Annual Subscriptions (Recurring, Trust-Based)
**What it monetizes:**  
- Peace of mind
- Planning and features
- Compounding value of Relationship Memory

**Why annual, not monthly:**
- Gifting is episodic
- Respects user behavior
- Higher commitment = higher trust signal

---

### What We Don't Do:
- ❌ No ads
- ❌ No monthly subscriptions
- ❌ No engagement traps
- ❌ No dark patterns

### Key Metric:
**Projected Blended ARPU: €37 per active user per year**

---

## Key Insights from Part 2

### 1. Psychology > Demographics
Market definition is behavioral, not demographic:
- Not "millennials" or "Gen Z"
- Not "high income" or "urban"
- **"People who experience gifting as high-stakes social decision"**

This makes the market:
- ✅ Global
- ✅ Scalable
- ✅ Culture-agnostic (with localization)

---

### 2. Three Distinct Personas = Different Value Props
- **Considerate Achiever:** Sells certainty & speed
- **Relationship Manager:** Sells structure & memory
- **Status-Conscious:** Sells zero cognitive load & curation

**Implication:** Product tiers should map to personas

---

### 3. Revenue Model is Trust-Aligned
- Affiliate = value delivered (purchase made)
- Subscription = trust earned (memory built)
- No monetization of attention or manipulation

**This is rare and valuable for investor narrative**
